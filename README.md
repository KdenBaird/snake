# Overview

The software that I wrote to demonstrate my learning and understanding of C++ language is a snake game. I assigned The fruit that the snake will eat as the "f" symbol, the head of the snake as the "O" symbol and the subesequent body as the "o" symbol

The purpose of me writing this software was so I was able to learn and implent the basic syntax and functionality of C++.

# Development Environment

The environment that I used to develop this software is Visual Studio 2022. This was a great opportunity for myself to learn how to use this text editor because I only have had experience with Visual Studio Code. 

Some libraries that I have included in this project were: vectors, algorithms, and threads.

# Future Work

- The board for the snake game is constantly flickering because the board is rapidly updating. I need to find a way how to fix this. 
- When the snake runs into walls or  it's own body, I would like the program to display a restart button and display the user their score instead of killing the program.
- I need to update the snake, fruit, and border to all be different colors for readability and it will look better.
